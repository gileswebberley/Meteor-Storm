Meteor Storm
As I went throught the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway (completed) and a few units of the Unity Creative Core Pathway I started this project as my prototype. I have continued to use this for learning as I work my way through a Unity 12 week Bootcamp. I created it as a playground and so the code got quite ugly but it has given me the opportunity to try to refactor it and learn about impementing OOD in C# (as I hadn't ever used it before Sept '22).
It's just a little space shooter game but it's becoming quite playable and teaching me a lot about the basics of game development. It contains my first attempt at implementing a score and leaderboard system along with all of the UI basics, player controls, and a game manager. As always, any feedback warmly received.
